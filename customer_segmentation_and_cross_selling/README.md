# Customer segmentation and effective cross selling
Customer segmentation is the problem of uncovering information about a firm’s customer base, based on their interactions with the business. This is an unsupervised learning task.  <br />
Cross selling is the ability to sell more products to a customer by analyzing the customer’s shopping trends as well as general shopping trends and patterns which are in common with the customer’s shopping patterns.  <br />
The objective of this project was to:
+ emphasize that the most important part of Machine Learning-based solution is the value it can deliver to the organization.
+ learn some important methods that have the potential to directly contribute to the revenue generation of organizations and retail establishments.
+ look at ideas pertaining to customer segmentation and explore ways of using unsupervised learning to find out customer segments.
+ use pattern-mining and rule-based frameworks like association rule mining and principles like market basket analysis.
+ use data parsing and pre-processing besides regular modeling and analysis.
