# Convolutional neural networks
This is the folder with the solved problems using CNNs <br />
The objective of these projects was to:
+ learn Python deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras)
+ learn how to implement CNNs
+ learn how to use transfer learning (e.g., using VGG19)
+ solve some real-world problems using CNNs
+ learn about artistic style transfer with CNNs
