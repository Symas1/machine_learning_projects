# Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks
Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks is a binary classification problem. The task is to train a model to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock. <br />
The objective of this project was to:
+ work through a classification predictive modeling problem end-to-end
+ use data visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data set
+ use data transforms to improve model performance
+ use algorithm tuning to improve model performance
+ use ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model performance.
