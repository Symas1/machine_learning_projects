# The bike sharing
The bike sharing is a regression predictive modeling machine learning problem. The task is to train a model to predict the bike rental demand. <br />
The objective of this project was to:
+ work through a regression predictive modeling problem end-to-end
+ use exploratory data analysis to explore and understand the dataset at hand
+ use data transforms to improve model performance
+ use regression analysis to understand regression modeling concepts and apply them to solve the problem
+ use algorithm tuning to improve model performance
