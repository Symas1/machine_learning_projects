# Boston house prices
Boston house prices is a regression predictive modeling machine learning problem. The task is to predict the price of the house, given some parameters (such as crime, areas of non-retail business in the town, the age of people who own the house, etc.). <br />
The objective of this project was to:
+ work through a regression predictive modeling problem end-to-end
+ use data visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data set
+ use data transforms to improve model performance
+ use algorithm tuning to improve model performance
+ use ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model performance.
