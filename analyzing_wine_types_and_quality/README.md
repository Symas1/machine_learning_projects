# Wine types and quality
Wine quality is a classification problem. The goal is to predict wine type and quality based on physicochemical tests <br />
The objective of this project was to:
+ analyze and visualize the data and its features, using descriptive and inferential statistics and univariate and multivariate analysis.
+ use ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model performance.
+ use techniques for interpreting models, including analyzing feature importances, visualizing model ROC curves and decision surfaces, explaining model predictions, and visualizing partial dependence plots.
+ predict if each wine sample is a red or white wine.
+ predict the quality of each wine sample, which can be low, medium, or high.
